# Algorithms_TLCA-ACR_Algorithm

**TLCA-ACR (Time-Location-Context-Aware Adaptive Cache Replacement)** is an intelligent, real-time caching algorithm that uses multi-dimensional signals‚Äîfrequency, recency, time, location, and contextual heuristics‚Äîto make proactive cache replacement decisions. It outperforms traditional policies like LRU/LFU in time-sensitive, location-aware, or context-dependent environments such as mobile apps, edge computing, or IoT systems.

## üîç Motivation

Conventional cache algorithms (e.g., LRU, LFU) only consider recent access or frequency, missing real-world signals like:

- **Time of day**
- **User location**
- **Device mode (e.g., gaming, silent, power-saving)**

These omissions lead to suboptimal cache performance, especially in dynamic, real-world scenarios. TLCA-ACR addresses this by dynamically scoring cache entries using context-aware inputs.

## üìê Score Formula
```Score(T) = Œ±‚ãÖfreq + Œ≤‚ãÖ(1/recency) + Œ≥‚ãÖcontext_value + Œ¥‚ãÖtime_weight(t) + œµ‚ãÖlocation_weight(x, y)```


Where:
- `freq`: Access frequency
- `recency`: Time since last access
- `context_value`: Heuristic signal (e.g., device mode, user behavior)
- `time_weight(t)`: Time-of-day importance
- `location_weight(x, y)`: Spatial importance
- `Œ±-œµ`: Tunable weights per application

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Adaptive scoring based on frequency, recency, time, location, and custom context
- ‚úÖ Pluggable scoring functions for time and location weighting
- ‚úÖ Tie-breaker eviction logic for fairness in scoring collisions
- ‚úÖ Real-time simulation support with runtime and memory measurement
- ‚úÖ Well-commented and extensible Python implementation

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- Call `put(key, value, t, loc)` to add or update cache entries.
- Call `get(key, t, loc)` to retrieve a value and update access metadata.
- Custom `context_fn`, `time_fn`, and `loc_fn` can be passed to shape behavior.

```python
cache.set_context_functions(
    context_fn=lambda: 1.0,
    time_fn=lambda t: 2.0 if 8 <= t <= 10 else 0.5,
    loc_fn=lambda x, y: 2.0 if (x, y) == (37.77, -122.42) else 0.5
)
